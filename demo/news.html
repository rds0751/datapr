                    <b>Mohali 16th November</b> <br> 

Aryans College of Law, Rajpura, Near Chandigarh today organized a seminar on “Fair Trial, Judiciary & Media: A need for Balance” at its Campus. Former Chief Justice of Punjab & Haryana High Court & Chairperson Haryana Human Rights Commission, Mr. Justice Vijender Jain was the Chief Guest on the occasion. Prof. D.N. Jauhar, Former Vice Chancellor, Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Agra & Dr. Vijay Nagpal, Former Chairperson, Dept of Laws, Panjab University were the Guests of Honour on the occasion while Dr. Anshu Kataria, Chairman, Aryans Group presided over the function. <br>

SDM Rajpura, Sh. Shiv Kumar was also present on the occasion. The seminar was attended by hundreds of students of LL.B & BA-LL.B of Aryans College of Law. The function started with Lamp lighting ceremony and welcome prayer by the students. <br>

Mr. Justice, Vijender Jain while speaking on the topic said that the media is regarded as the fourth pillar of any democracy. An independent media is necessary for keeping a check on the government and its organs. But with the increasing corporatization of media and the race to grab more eyeballs for higher numbers, the media is overstepping its boundaries which need to be regulated.  <br>

Prof. D.N. Jauhar discussed about Media Trial & Professional Ethics. He highlighted the role & importance of proper curriculum to ensure ethics in the students which is missing in the curriculum these days. He said, “Every individual presumed to be innocent till found guilty. Various Media Resources including Press, TV, Satellites, Social Media, Internet etc present a refined & researched version of the story. To win the race, they have begun to publish and present what the ‘public is interested in’ rather that what is for ‘public interest.’ <br>

Prof. Vijay Nagpal while speaking said that media has wide ranging roles and plays a vital role in shaping the opinion of the society, but like every other freedom and liberty, this freedom of speech and expression is also seen to be misused by the media. Every institution is liable to be abused, and every liberty, if left unbridled, has the tendency to become a license that would lead to disorder and anarchy. <br>

Nagpal further said that without an active media, the cries of the victims of brutal khap killings of Haryana would have gone unheard. Many other cases like the Arushi Murder Case, Jessica Lal Murder Case, Ruchika Girhotra Case and even the games played in IPL Row was brought out into broad daylight because of the laudable efforts of media. This is certainly a very positive and welcome act from the part of the media. <br>

Prof. B.S Sidhu, Director, Aryans Group said that the responsibility of the media is greater than the responsibility of an individual because the media has a larger audience. The freedom of press should neither degenerate into a license to attack litigants and close the door of justice, nor can it include any unrestricted liberty to damage the reputation of respectable persons. <br>

Mr. Steven Jawinda, Registrar, Aryans Group said that the media is now a full -fledged business. The present day trend in news reporting manifestly points out that Journalism and ethics stand apart. Journalists and media persons are supposed to be distinctive facilitators for the democratic process to function without hindrance. The journalists and reporters are compelled to meet deadlines, satisfy media managers by meeting growing targets and so on. Coupled with this there is also cut throat competition between different media houses and newspaper organizations. <br>

<b>Chandigarh 14th October  </b> <br>
Aryans College of Law organizes a seminar on Legal Education<br>

Aryans College of Law, Chandigarh today organized a seminar on “Legal Education in India: Past, Present & Future” in PHD Chamber, Sector-31, A Chandigarh. S. Fatehdeep Singh, Hon’ble Justice, Punjab & Haryana High Court was the Chief Guest on the occasion.<br>

Dr. Anmol Rattan Sidhu, President, Punjab & Haryana High Court Bar Association; Advocate H.C Arora, Social Activist;S. Ravinder Singh Bassi, President, District Bar Association, Chandigarh; were the Guests of Honour while Dr. Anshu Kataria, Chairman, Aryans Group presided over the function.<br>

The function commenced with the lamp lighting ceremony by the guests. The seminar was attended by over 300 LL.B and BA-LL.B students of Aryans in 2 different morning & evening session.<br>

Justice Fatehdeep Singh While speaking said that the concept of legal education in India goes back to the Vedic age when it was essentially based on the concept of Dharma. The Kings either used to dispense justice themselves or appoint Judges and Assessors to administer justice. In year 1857, first step was taken to impart formal legal education in the country by setting up three universities, in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.<br>

Justice Fatehdeep Singh further said that with the advancement of technology on the one hand there would be ease and reduction in pending court cases while on the other hand over use of technology is leading to the growth of cyber crime also.<br>

Justice Fatehdeep Singh further said that over the years, there has been a considerable degeneration of academic standards within law departments due to the challenges being faced by legal institutions including Physical infrastructure, financial resources, Need for developing philanthropic initiatives, Hiring good teachers & researchers etc. As a result, the ability to attract serious students with a passionate commitment to study law has always been a challenge across the country.<br>

Dr. Anmol Rattan Sidhu while speaking about the past said that before India attained independence in 1947, there were only a few law schools in the country. With the independence of the country, legal education acquired importance, as rule of law became a fundamental doctrine for the governance of the country. After democratic form of Government it became necessary that judicial system of the country should be brought in tune with social, economic and political needs of the society. Gradually legal education was introduced as a course of study in a number of States.<br>

H.C Arora while speaking about the present scenario said that the quality of legal education has a direct impact on the prestige of the legal profession and thus we should identify the areas of default and initiate corrective action to repair the damage. <br>

Ravinder Bassi speaking about the future of legal education said that Legal education must be given its status of a professional course of study and like any other professional course its standards must be regulated. The senior members of the Bar must suggest means for attracting the students to the profession. <br>

Dr. Anshu Kataria while speaking on the occasion said that in past few years legal education has become popular among the students. He further said that around 50,000 candidates appeared in CLAT -2017 against around 2342 seats in 18 National Universities of Law in India which shows the huge competition across the Country.<br>
